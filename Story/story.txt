A hund in lederhose went to the baeckerei. He picked up an apfelkuchen and some brots. Then he went to the Stadtpark. 
He decided to lassen the stradtpark and drive his new Porsche while jamming out to musik. He decided to ate his apfelkuchen while driving this Porsche.
Bedauerlicherweise he decieded to got to berlin an is a very wettbewerbsfaehig driver.
He decided to ditch his Porsche and walk down the Hauptstrasse.
After he ditched his Porsche, a hero drove up in a BMW, and it was Dr. Mehlhase of course. 
And what did our hero have to say, of course everyone gets an A.
